This is a basic roadmap of these helper scripts.

1. kpo2.pl 
# This script creates the contrib dir from svn and git sources, copying only 
# the po files and creating a uniform structure for the po files.
#
# This is not run too often, just when adding new kde files as svn is 
# updated and gnome git files are updated. 
#
# Should be updated when KDE completes move to GIT version control.

1.5 atomize.pl
# This script will extract the necessary texts for command line 
# parameters from the core-utils po files and create a new directory
# to be processed along with the core-utils po files upon executing
# po2.pl. Input directory is coded to 8.20. Modify as necessary.

2. po2.pl 
# Fast and dirty. This will merge files from xffm, core, gnome and kde 
# source .po files, in the specified order. Duplicated elements are
# discarded, as well as untranslated or fuzzy msgid's.

2.5 (deprecated) po3.pl
# This will merge source po files from two directories. This is to be run 
# if at later time you want to add po files from different source, like
# the core-utils po files. 

3. clean_po.pl
# Fast and clean. Once "make update-po" has run successfully, use this script
# to cleanout all the commented translations which are not used in Rodent
# applications. This will also remove the translators string that appears 
# in the "about" dialog, so mk_translators.pl should follow this one, always.
#
# Use this script before doing a commit, always.

4. mk_translators.pl
# This script adds the translators message. Always run this script after 
# doing an "make update-po", since the make process will comment out any
# previous translators string".
# 
# This is the final step in .po preparation for .gmo.
