To install:
1) create a directory "build"
2) cd build
3) cmake ..
4) make
5) sudo make install

If necessary dependencies are met, this will install xffm+ in /usr/local.
If a different installation path is desired, please modify CMakeLists.txt

Enjoy!



For new translation construction:
1. Put full po files in build/po
2. In build/po, do make --makefile=Makefile.autotools check 
    (this verifies POTFILE.in from xffm/po is correct,
     if not correct, fix it.)
3. In build/po, do make --makefile=Makefile.autotools distclean
     (clean start)
4. In build/po, do make --makefile=Makefile.autotools update-po
     (updates the po files with new translations)
5. In build/po, do make --makefile=Makefile.autotools 
     (creates new gmo files)
6. In build/po, do perl clean.pl [all po files] and move .new -> .po
     (removes comments and unnecessary stuff from po files)
     (shortcut: perl cleanall.pl)
     (rm *.bak)
7. copy po and gmo files to xffm/po
     (this saves to git all previous work)
