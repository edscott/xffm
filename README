TODO: 
  * back to xfterm branch
  * transform start.hh into a class template: affects xfterm.cc and xffm.cc
  * bug: on starting xffm/xfterm with no path, toolbar does not show full path.
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.
  x bash completion: bugs fixed, now in observation
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
  * simple rcfile for environment, monitor changes and reload (font size, window size)
  * 20 files with FIXMEs
