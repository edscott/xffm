    bug: local Goto entry does not have bash completion, append slash to path, ant pathbar is broken
    bug: treeview loading of /usr/share/texmf-dist/tex/latex is way too slow:
         we need a modal dialog and insensitivize mainWindow, at least, with a 
         update of files loaded in the dialog... This should be fired up at the
         loadModel() level for all models.
    pkg module now shows packages and search results
    
    Pending, activate will simply install or uninstall depending on case.
    pacman -Syy will run before any install, but not on uninstall.
    
    And that will be all
    We will also remove the libxml2 dependency.


When logo appears, if click on window before logo window disappears, we can have
a glib thread crash

  pending: fix popupmenu for /dev/disks
  pending: maybe not... make openwith and run with independent and with a timeout if user does not act on them (say 30 seconds).
             
bug: 
 ** In treeview, on going to popup with button 3 and multiple selection, multiple selection is working but items are unselected from the treeview.
 
 - progress dialog for rm/trash/shred
 > use libmagic preferably instead of perl if available
 > printout optional and required libraries found in configure step.
 
 . multiple windows will trigger multiple timeout dialogs on mount items.
   (maybe define an xatom for first one, value = 1 and -1 when none is defined)
  ** Seems to be nonissue, since dialogs are placed on top of each other and dissappear
     at same time. The only issue would be if user dismisses top dialog, it would appear
     not to go away...
       
 . timeout dialog requires a progress bar on timeout
 . timeout dialog requires a "Dismiss" button.


TODO
  * history internal lpterm command. Enable use of | grep to filter output...

  * check tarball creation output in lpterm (also enable multiple file processing if several compressed files
    of the same mimetype are selected simultaneously.

  * add bookmarks to rootview: 
    - put localviewpopup basics into rootview, popup menu to remove bookmark... maybe
    
       Ctl selection was necessary in treeview and to avoid selection of somthing off screen
       keep it that way.
  * enable sort modes 
     - Type
     - Name
     - Date
     - up/down

Bugs:
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

Cleanups:  
  * 20+ files with FIXMEs
