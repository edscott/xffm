 . multiple windows will trigger multiple timeout dialogs on mount items.
   (maybe define an xatom for first one, value = 1 and -1 when none is defined)
 . timeout dialog requires a progress bar on timeout
 . timeout dialog requires a "Dismiss" button.


Important: Save and restore size of find dialog if user resizes it, but
           also set a minimum size the user may resize to.


TODO
  * history internal lpterm command. Enable use of | grep to filter output...

  * check tarball creation output in lpterm 

  * add bookmarks to rootview: 
    - put localviewpopup basics into rootview, popup menu to remove bookmark... maybe
    
    
  * enable localview popup
     - duplicate/symlink/rename
     - cutnpaste
     - properties
  * enable previews
  * enable DnD
     - iconview need not use internal DnD. Use special DnD to enable multiple selections
       Ctl selection was necessary in treeview and to avoid selection of somthing off screen
       keep it that way.
  * enable listview
  * enable sort modes 
     - Type
     - Name
     - Date
     - up/down

Bugs:
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

Cleanups:  

  * transform start.hh into a class template: affects xfterm.cc and xffm.cc
  * 20+ files with FIXMEs
