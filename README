  * enable previews
  * enable DnD
     - iconview need not use internal DnD. Use special DnD to enable multiple selections
       Ctl selection was necessary in treeview and to avoid selection of somthing off screen
       keep it that way.
  * enable treeview now!
  * enable listview
  * enable showhidden

Bugs:
  * bug: symlink to directory does not show correct icon and is not grouped with directories.
  * bug: no completion on 'executable ""' when exeecutable is specified, should display file options (all).
  * bug: on starting xffm/xfterm with no path, toolbar does not show full path.
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

Cleanups:  

  * transform start.hh into a class template: affects xfterm.cc and xffm.cc
  * simple rcfile for environment, monitor changes and reload (font size, window size)
  * 20+ files with FIXMEs
