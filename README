bug: 
>> duplicate/rename/symlink should not be sensitive if more than one item selected.
 . local monitor does not insert new files in sort order
 > use libmagic preferably instead of perl if available
 > printout optional and required libraries found in configure step.
 
 . multiple windows will trigger multiple timeout dialogs on mount items.
   (maybe define an xatom for first one, value = 1 and -1 when none is defined)
 . timeout dialog requires a progress bar on timeout
 . timeout dialog requires a "Dismiss" button.


TODO
  * history internal lpterm command. Enable use of | grep to filter output...

  * check tarball creation output in lpterm 

  * add bookmarks to rootview: 
    - put localviewpopup basics into rootview, popup menu to remove bookmark... maybe
    
       Ctl selection was necessary in treeview and to avoid selection of somthing off screen
       keep it that way.
  * enable sort modes 
     - Type
     - Name
     - Date
     - up/down

Bugs:
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

Cleanups:  
  * 20+ files with FIXMEs
