Xffm+ is a gtk3 application. Not compatible with gtk2 linked apps (and maybe even other X apps, YMMV). In particular, drag and drop operations may not work correctly, since gtk3 protocols have been altered. This is most noticeable if you use gvim and are use to open files by drag and drop. The first file may open correctly, but subsequent files will not. This is *not* an xffm+ bug, but rather a gtk3 detail. The fix for gvim is to compile with gtk3. This is the current default (december 2018) for ArchLinux and FreeBSD. Gentoo may require compilation with the gtk3 USE flag (see /etc/portage/make.conf).


1. History of xffm
   xftree, gtk1.x
   xffm gtk2.x
   rodent gtk2.24-3.10
   xffm+ gtk3.24
What's behind the design of xffm
 Generic C++ programming, inspired by dune/dumux from U of Stutgart
 I am working with the code from UoS, and to better understand the manner 
 in which generic programming is used, I am writing (I wrote) a new version 
 of xffm with generic programming and gtk+-3.24.1 as minimu requirement.
 Dependencies have been reduced to a minimum, although inclusion of all optional
 dependencies provide a much better experience.

reduce bloatware to a minimum
