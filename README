 . multiple windows will trigger multiple timeout dialogs on mount items.
   (maybe define an xatom for first one, value = 1 and -1 when none is defined)
  ** Seems to be nonissue, since dialogs are placed on top of each other and dissappear
     at same time. The only issue would be if user dismisses top dialog, it would appear
     not to go away...
       
 . timeout dialog requires a progress bar on timeout
 . timeout dialog requires a "Dismiss" button.


TODO
  * history internal lpterm command. Enable use of | grep to filter output...

  * check tarball creation output in lpterm (also enable multiple file processing if several compressed files
    of the same mimetype are selected simultaneously.

  * add bookmarks to rootview: 
    - put localviewpopup basics into rootview, popup menu to remove bookmark... maybe
    
       Ctl selection was necessary in treeview and to avoid selection of somthing off screen
       keep it that way.
  * enable sort modes 
     - Type
     - Name
     - Date
     - up/down

Bugs:
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed

Cleanups:  
  * 20+ files with FIXMEs
