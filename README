TODO: 
  * back to xfterm branch
  * vpane placement bug:
    - identified placement is correct on initial window, and incorrect
      on all subsequent windows without call to page::showIconview().
      Apparently there is a race once the new page is added and the geometry
      of the vpane changes... The bug has been identified. Not yet fixed.
  * bash completion: 
    - finds directory and appends /, giving // to output
    - if directory and executable are options, directory options are not
      presented in output, only executable (not a bug:
      same happens in bash shell!)
    - finds item but outputs "Found no match"
    - when directory in input, and no match or multiple match, returns
      "found no match"
  * xffind:
    - on close/destroy signal gtk_widget_hide failed 
       GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
  * simple rcfile for environment, monitor changes and reload (font size, window size)
  * new tab shows iconview always in slow box (geminis) pinpoints problem.
  * on return with blank line: /bin/bash -c is executed...
  * 20 files with FIXMEs
