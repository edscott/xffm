Cheatsheet.

To update your SourceForge project homepage, 
you upload your custom HTML/CSS/JS files 
via SFTP (using clients like FileZilla 
or command line) to the 
/home/project-web/<projectname>/htdocs/ 
directory on web.sourceforge.net.

Once logged in with ftp, just cd htdocs to
get into /home/project-web/<projectname>/htdocs/
