Fgr
    The Fgr program is small and simple command line application to find files and pipe the result to grep in order to refine the search based on content. Fgr is a command line find tool which combines the power of "find" with the versatility of "grep".

GUI
    A graphic front end for fgr is available in the Rodent filemanager (http://rodent.xffm.org). If you install Rodent filemanager then fgr is already installed. If you do not install Rodent filemanager, then you can install fgr as a stand alone command line tool suitable for use from the terminal. Help on usage is available via "man fgr".

Development
    Fgr first appeared (called glob) in the year 2000 in the xfce3 desktop. Currently the application is included with Rodent Filemanager (http://xffm.org). Fgr can be installed along with Rodent Filemanager or as a standalone application. This allows for quick and easy installation in any system. The fgr program does not have any dependencies, except for GNU grep 2.x or higher if you want to search into the content of files.
