 Search tool for Rodent (aka, graphic front end to command line fgr). 
  </p>
  <p>
 Fgr is a succesor of command line glob which works in combination with grep 
 (either GNU or BSD version) by means of thread controlled pipes (libtubo). 
 Rodent-fgr is meant to be a desktop graphic interface to fgr to compliment
 fast, small and powerful file management. Rodent-fgr is specially thought 
 out for the maintainance of large sets of source code and is highly customizable,
 either from the rodent-fm settings dialog ---if installed--- or else by setting 
 the corresponding environment variables.  Content search is left to the excellent
 code developed by GNU grep <a href="http://git.sv.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git/tree/AUTHORS">authors</a>,
 without duplicating any code. Updates to GNU grep are used automatically. 
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>GNU's not Unix, but Unix is a beast; its plural form is Unixen.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  You probably want to install this application if you are having problems
  searching for files based on content.
