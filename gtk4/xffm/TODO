Sporadic race condition crashes:
* mountThreadF1 with gridview list model, at getMntHash, fstabMonitor.hh:120 (apparently there is a condition in which Child::lockGridView("mountThreadF1") fails to keep things coherent).


- Simplify OpenWith by inhering from DialogComplex (eliminate duplicated functions from DialogBasic)
- menu pathbar color bug
- font size slider for output


* mount function FileDialog (once efs file dialog is complete).
* gridview: verify tab labels with load gridview
* rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
 
* tar/untar, zip/unzip dialog
* gridview: ecryptfs dialog and root elements
* gridview: mount/unmount and fstab root elements
* xffm-find4
* tooltip on nondirectory icons (maybe not).
