OpenWith dialog (window) working

BUGS in Kubuntu
1. popup menu from gridview does not locate correctly, so that bottom part is 
not visible. Besides, hard to find spot to open menu. So, the gridview menu
will be moved to main menu. I guess this will not be a problem, as it will apply to current gridview_p.
2. On signal pressed, selection does not select the single affected item, but some others as well, as if the shift was down or something. What happens is that the selection is done on the item before the filter, so that the position is offset by the number of hidden/backup items which are not visible. Not a kubuntu bug, but due to hide/show options for directory


Pending issues: 
* show/hide hidden and backup files 
* put toggle text mode in tty menus
* sort order
* DnD: Watch out for gtk4 bugfixes  
* tar/untar, zip/unzip dialog
* main menu css format corrections
* gridview: verify linebreaks with iconsize
* gridview: verify tab labels with load gridview
* gridview: ecryptfs dialog and root elements
* gridview: mount/unmount and fstab root elements
* xffm-find4
* pathbar menu: verify
* For symlinks, add symlink emblem to icon.
* For executables, add exe emblem.
* rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
* tooltip on nondirectory icons.
* sort by size/date/type buttons (toggle buttons in vbuttonbox)
