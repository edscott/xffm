1. on no find results, we get the following at stderr:
(process:1009228): Gtk-CRITICAL **: 21:01:48.369: gtk_accessible_text_get_contents: assertion 'end >= start' failed
ERROR> No Data->findList

2.Failed (comments in code) modified rename with only entry and placed on mouse position


*** Need to add dropdown history for path entry in find dialog!
*** BUG: need to chain link dialogs, when a dialog1 has a dialog2 and enter
signal to dialog1_parent received, then dialog2 must raise, *not* dialog1.
*** another related BUG: when find action is performed, the window which gets
raised is the dialog1_parent window, but results are shown in dialog1, which should be raised. When dndBox is enabled, then we must chain dndBox as dialog2 with dialog1 as dialog2_parent.
*** Bug: cancel button is not unsensitivized when find action is unsuccessful.

BUG: hmmm: Where and why did this happen? on mouse click to select, if not ctrl, others not unselected.
BUG: Fixed: now in testing. Massive memory leak plugged. 
       [showstopper: dnd many times to gvim, eventually slowdown and deadlock and crash. This is due to massive
       memory leak. Drag items are not removed from memory since Dnd::dropDone is not called nor drag_ memory
       is cleaned.]


BUG (annoying): Resize window with several tabs and output a plenty, no coredump, apparent hang, but really just taking a lot of time to figure things out, in the end program continues, but this is annoying.


*** bug: small iconsize and icon shading mask not really visible. Need to make more constrast



*** BUG xffm3: with multiple instances of xffm3, navigating into a folder with images previewed breaks xffm3 run: no icons shown, tab label broken. Seems like a memory overright problem. Should verify with Valgrind.


* changed_f does an insert sorted, but result is not sorted. I guess we have to 
get a new selection model from the store and set it to the gridview.


0. Rodent icons
1. for mount entry set default mount point, either from fstab or ~/mnt/device
2. do not save invalid efs items, and allow popup item to remove
3. no menu pathbar (not even color bug...)
5. xffm-find4

Sporadic race condition crashes: Must set all gridview_p references in main context in order for Child::validGridView() to be correct.



- Simplify OpenWith by inhering from DialogComplex (eliminate duplicated functions from DialogBasic)


* mount function FileDialog (once efs file dialog is complete).
* WTF? rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
 
* tar/untar, zip/unzip dialog
* gridview: ecryptfs dialog and root elements
* gridview: mount/unmount and fstab root elements
* xffm-find4
* tooltip on nondirectory icons (maybe not).
