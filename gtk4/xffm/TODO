OpenWith dialog (window) working

Pending issues: 
   DONE enable bash completion
   DONE fill in with default mime command
   DONE enable mimecommand completion (new):
   DONE   maybe a column of valid mimeapps selectable. 
OpenWith:
DONE 1. Change GtkEntry in openwith to a GtkTextView to enable bash completion.
   (set output to NULL: verify this)
DONE 2. Put default mimetype command as inicial value in 1). Have text selected
   so that single keystroke will reset.
3. OpenWith with multiple files selected (this when selection menu enabled)
4. Missing menu classes:
     pathbar menu
     selection menu (single/multiple)
5. (experimental) Move colors popover to rise from the colors item in main menu:
    on rising, popdown main menu. associate color popover to some other
6.  rotate for images in image popover menu
7.  For symlinks, add symlink emblem to icon.
8.  For executables, add exe emblem.
9.  rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
10. tooltip on nondirectory icons.
11. sort by size/date/type buttons (toggle buttons in vbuttonbox)
12. enable all menu button callbacks
13. xffm-find
14. xffm-askpassword
