file chooser not updating tree in efs and mount
Incorrect dirname to construct path when entry is set in mount
Mkdir will create directory in pathbar red, and not in selected directory
Bunch of GtkCriticals in filechooser in mount (full parameters not set)

Sporadic race condition crashes:
* mountThreadF1 with gridview list model, at getMntHash, fstabMonitor.hh:120 (apparently there is a condition in which Child::lockGridView("mountThreadF1") fails to keep things coherent).


- Simplify OpenWith by inhering from DialogComplex (eliminate duplicated functions from DialogBasic)
- menu pathbar color bug
- font size slider for output


* mount function FileDialog (once efs file dialog is complete).
* gridview: verify tab labels with load gridview
* rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
 
* tar/untar, zip/unzip dialog
* gridview: ecryptfs dialog and root elements
* gridview: mount/unmount and fstab root elements
* xffm-find4
* tooltip on nondirectory icons (maybe not).
