*** BUG: dnd broken: drag from xffm3 to xffm4 move mode, a dialog will open asking if copy move or symlink. Select move. Item will not be moved, but will be removed from source. Seems like copy/paste may be broken too.
*** bug: small iconsize and icon shading mask not really visible. Need to make more constrast
*** bug: check this... on renaming a file to existing, move src to tgt, tgt exists, backup file created for src, not tgt!!! 


*** BUG xffm3: with multiple instances of xffm3, navigating into a folder with images previewed breaks xffm3 run: no icons shown, tab label broken. Seems like a memory overright problem. Should verify with Valgrind.




0. Rodent icons
1. for mount entry set default mount point, either from fstab or ~/mnt/device
2. do not save invalid efs items, and allow popup item to remove
3. no menu pathbar (not even color bug...)
4. font size slider for input/output at menu
5. xffm-find4

Sporadic race condition crashes:
* mountThreadF1 with gridview list model, at getMntHash, fstabMonitor.hh:120 (apparently there is a condition in which Child::lockGridView("mountThreadF1") fails to keep things coherent).


- Simplify OpenWith by inhering from DialogComplex (eliminate duplicated functions from DialogBasic)


* mount function FileDialog (once efs file dialog is complete).
* WTF? rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
 
* tar/untar, zip/unzip dialog
* gridview: ecryptfs dialog and root elements
* gridview: mount/unmount and fstab root elements
* xffm-find4
* tooltip on nondirectory icons (maybe not).
