0. broken icons in kubuntu symlink
1. for mount entry set default mount point, either from fstab or ~/mnt/device
2. do not save invalid efs items, and allow popup item to remove
3. no menu pathbar (not even color bug...)
4. font size slider for input/output at menu
5. xffm-find4

Sporadic race condition crashes:
* mountThreadF1 with gridview list model, at getMntHash, fstabMonitor.hh:120 (apparently there is a condition in which Child::lockGridView("mountThreadF1") fails to keep things coherent).


- Simplify OpenWith by inhering from DialogComplex (eliminate duplicated functions from DialogBasic)


* mount function FileDialog (once efs file dialog is complete).
* WTF? rename/duplicate/symlink entry inside listItemWidget(say button3, button 1 to goto). Here we could use a gtk entry, set to 
 
* tar/untar, zip/unzip dialog
* gridview: ecryptfs dialog and root elements
* gridview: mount/unmount and fstab root elements
* xffm-find4
* tooltip on nondirectory icons (maybe not).
