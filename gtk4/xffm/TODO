In green output after copy/move, specify src-->tgt (src basename or "multipleFiles")


When you select text from an entry in find dialog, it is not always copied to
the button 2 X clipboard. This is bad. Must put in controller so that whenever
stuff is selected from entries, it is copied to the Xorg button 2 clipboard. I've gotta look up how to do that...
