Rodent vector icon theme
(c) Fran√ßois Le Clainche <fleclainche at wanadoo.fr> - 2004 - 2005

This icon theme is released under the terms of the GNU GPL v2 or later.


NOTES

The goal of this theme is to be clean and obvious.

I did my best to follow the relevant icon section of the Gnome 
Human Interface Guidelines, in particular regarding the colors:
http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/images/ximian-palette

Are included:
- approximately 500 icons in SVG format
- all the corresponding copies in PNG format
- almost all icons for a unified Xfce4/Gtk2 interface


STOCK ICONS

If you want to use the "stock" icons of this theme, you 
must add the path to the Rodent iconrc file to your 
$DATADIR/themes/favorite_theme/gtk-2.0/gtkrc file.

To achieve this, add one of the following lines at the top 
of your gtkrc:

include "$DATADIR/icons/Rodent/iconrc"

or, if your system does not support the SVG format:

include "$DATADIR/icons/Rodent/iconrc-png"

where $DATADIR is usually /usr/share or /usr/local/share.
