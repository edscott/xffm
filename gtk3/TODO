Disabled background mode since g_monitor does not does not work (ubuntu Linux asus 6.8.0-44-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Aug 13 13:35:26 UTC 2024 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux). This is a bug that appeared in g_monitor in some later glib version. Can do without background mode since dmenu/i3 executes. 

When monitor is not working:
   remove a file (icon will not dissappear)
   drag and drop the ghost icon into gvim 
   crash ensues.
   Should fix this, even if monitor is working. Probably just need a g_file_test
   before begin the drag.
