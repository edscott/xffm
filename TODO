NEXT:
     1-Use magic in mime-module (not currently enabled) This should fix more
       icons.
     3-Use # for setting add_color_pixbuf() and use gray for hidden files
     4-Use emblemized icon for trash/backup files
     5-Use binary emblem for binary files or binary icon...

    *6-Add filter to xfdir_local_c read, to filter out hidden/trash/backup or regex files.
       This would require view_trash, view_hidden toggles and set_filter button.
       When filter is applied, should be shown in status line
     7-Add command dialog with activate 
        (command from mime-command or user history)

Pending:
     1-Label colors according to file MIMETYPE (C header and src colors)
       this is in pixbuf_icons_c, but mimetype is in xfdir_local_c
       This will be solved on solving 3 above.
     2-Use a treemodel column for file extension for optimization
       (probably not necessary)


lpterm_c.cpp:
 * CTL callbacks...
 * icon selection by keyboard
 pixbuf_hash_c.cpp
 * check, remake out of date thumbnails/previews as needed
 run_button_c.cpp
 * workdir not set nor used (probably not needed...)
 * show info callback is not functional
 * reload icons when command has completed (rather signal monitor
   to check and perform a reload if necessary)
 * enable functionality of rfm_remove_child()
 run_c.cpp
 * fork_mutex must live across objects (why? check validity)
 * fix exit status test for view or window to stop output
   to nonexistent textview
 signal_action_c.cpp
 * check whether reload is necessary after process is signaled.
 thread_control_c.cpp
 * check usage of thread_control object
 tooltip_c.cpp
 * fix dual behavior of create_tooltip_window() (split into two functions)
 * check why composite shading no longer works in gtk-3.20
 view_c.cpp
 * Drag and drop setup for iconview
 * Check which callbacks are necessary and which are not.
 xfdir_c.cpp
 * Activate a symlink to directory should not set realpath in pathbar
   nor in view_p->path
