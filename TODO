For 0.95
OK, in debug mode:Critical: need to reenable heartbeat timeout for all g_file_tests, as if not, stale nfs conexion will hang program.

OK, in debug mode: *Set error and info colors from menupopover
*(BSD) Enable LocalMonitor::startMountThread for watching mount
*(BSD) Enable fstab monitor to watch for fstab/mtab changes

OK, in debug mode: fixed. Maybe setttings file could still be lost. Probably fixed: settings bug: problem with settings file. Seems like it is zapped somehow and when zapped and menu opened, listview is automatically selected. Background color is lost as well as all other saved settings...

BSD stuff
- fstab partitions for BSD (if possible) and ZFS dealings
- monitor fstab module in BSD (maybe)
- root items popup shows mount item 


For 0.92
  Add correct translations to customini.hh
  Remove the unmount option in the filechooser (only mountpoints...)  

For 0.91

click item, open with combo dialog selected gvim, press ok. bug:gvim does not open file... sometimes, FreeBSD. May not be related to xffm


Cleanups:  
  * FIXMEs here and there

Wishlist:
  * history internal lpterm command. Enable use of | grep to filter output...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha:
Logo:
    * When logo appears, if click on window before logo window disappears, 
       we can have a glib thread crash

FSTAB:
    * multiple windows will trigger multiple timeout dialogs on mount items.
      (maybe define an xatom for first one, value = 1 and -1 when none is defined)
    * BSD mode not working
    * greenball update icon in local is disabled. Using the threaded monitor function
      from fstab to signal changes causes crash. I believe due to double treeview now
      used in local view. Maybe put thread within local view. but that complicates things
      for freebsd version.
    * fix popupmenu for /dev/disks
    * Seems to be nonissue, since dialogs are placed on top of each other and dissappear
      at same time. The only issue would be if user dismisses top dialog, it would appear
      not to go away...
       . timeout dialog requires a progress bar on timeout
       . timeout dialog requires a "Dismiss" button.

PKG:
    * Need to be able to set evironment variables for proxy on pkg module: 
    have commands run in a custom app window.
    * send stderr to output as when pkg fails, database needs manual update "pkg update",
       add item to menu...
    * Rebuild of pkg system: top level should have groups. next installed packages.
    * pacman -Syy will run before any install, but not on uninstall.

Structure:
    needs file selector box with bash completion at current directory (?)
    needs executable definition for OK button (?)
    needs in terminal (xterm) button (for gccproblem26)(?)
    needs way to set and insenditivize options if in terminal is not selected
    (for gccproblem26)(?)
