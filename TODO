Bug:
 * once diagnostics has reached line limit, further output appears broken, 
   and sortof fixes with scrollup/down. Apparently further output is being 
   output to incorrect part of the text buffer, instead of the end. Clean
   diagnostics fixes the problem.

lpterm_c.cpp:
 * CTL callbacks...
 * icon selection by keyboard
pathbar_c.cpp:
 * Go to module or top xffm level when dot button pressed
 pixbuf_hash_c.cpp
 * check, remake out of date thumbnails/previews as needed
 run_button_c.cpp
 * workdir not set nor used
 * show info callback is not functional
 * reload icons when command has completed (rather signal monitor
   to check and perform a reload if necessary)
 * enable functionality of rfm_remove_child()
 run_c.cpp
 * fork_mutex must live across objects (why? check validity)
 * fix exit status test for view or window to stop output
   to nonexistent textview
 signal_action_c.cpp
 * check whether reload is necessary after process is signaled.
 thread_control_c.cpp
 * check usage of thread_control object
 tooltip_c.cpp
 * fix dual behavior of create_tooltip_window() (split into two functions)
 * check why composite shading no longer works in gtk-3.20
 view_c.cpp
 * Drag and drop setup for iconview
 * Check which callbacks are necessary and which are not.
 * enable title and icon changes on switch page (not needed until
   modules can be loaded)
 xfdir_c.cpp
 * need to tag links to directories appropriately so that the icon
   is correct. 
 * Icons which are links to directories must be placed next to directory icons
 * Activate a symlink to directory should not set realpath in pathbar
   nor in view_p->path
