Bugs:
  * bug: do a "git branch whatever" in script mode. Script will expect input
         and cannot be terminated by menu signals...
	 update: on a script command that loops, the kill pid is incorrect.

Cleanups:  
  * 20+ files with FIXMEs

Wishlist:
  * history internal lpterm command. Enable use of | grep to filter output...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alpha:
Logo:
    * When logo appears, if click on window before logo window disappears, 
       we can have a glib thread crash

FSTAB:
    * multiple windows will trigger multiple timeout dialogs on mount items.
      (maybe define an xatom for first one, value = 1 and -1 when none is defined)
    * BSD mode not working
    * greenball update icon in local is disabled. Using the threaded monitor function
      from fstab to signal changes causes crash. I believe due to double treeview now
      used in local view. Maybe put thread within local view. but that complicates things
      for freebsd version.
    * fix popupmenu for /dev/disks
    * Seems to be nonissue, since dialogs are placed on top of each other and dissappear
      at same time. The only issue would be if user dismisses top dialog, it would appear
      not to go away...
       . timeout dialog requires a progress bar on timeout
       . timeout dialog requires a "Dismiss" button.

PKG:
    * Need to be able to set evironment variables for proxy on pkg module: 
    have commands run in a custom app window.
    * send stderr to output as when pkg fails, database needs manual update "pkg update",
       add item to menu...
    * Rebuild of pkg system: top level should have groups. next installed packages.
    * pacman -Syy will run before any install, but not on uninstall.

Structure:
    needs file selector box with bash completion at current directory (?)
    needs executable definition for OK button (?)
    needs in terminal (xterm) button (for gccproblem26)(?)
    needs way to set and insenditivize options if in terminal is not selected
    (for gccproblem26)(?)
